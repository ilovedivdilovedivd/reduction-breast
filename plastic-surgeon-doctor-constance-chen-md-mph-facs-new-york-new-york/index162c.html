<div class="fullTableCell">Imaging for silicone implant rupture <br><i>Jul 29, 2022</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">The best imaging to show silicone implant rupture is a breast MRI. If an MRI is not possible, an ultrasound may also show an obvious rupture or even a mammogram. That said, no radiologic imaging is perfect. You could get a breast MRI that did not show a rupture and still have a rupture. Alternatively, the breast MRI could show a rupture and then there could be no rupture when the implant is removed. At the end of the day, the only way to know with 100% certainty whether or not you have a...</div>

</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Yes, you can have your implants out without putting new ones in. It will likely require more than one surgery to look acceptable, however. 575 cc implants are large, and the implants have stretched out your skin and compressed what breast tissue you have. Pregnancy has also stretched out your skin. Your best way forward is to remove your implants with complete en bloc capsulectomies at the first surgery. The removal of the entire implant capsule will allow your stretched out skin to contract...</div>

<div class="fullTableCell">If you were a small A cup before implants and a D cup with them, then your skin has stretched a fair amount and your breast tissue is compressed. In addition, if it was 23 years ago, and you are the same weight that you were when your implants were placed, you may not have a lot of additional breast tissue. Your best result would likely be a staged procedure. First, remove your breast implants and allow your skin to contract and your breast tissue to decompress (I.e., "fluff"). You breasts...</div>

</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">415 cc implants are large, but your breasts are not very ptotic. If you can handle it psychologically, I think you should have implant removal with complete en bloc capsulectomies and no additional procedures. I would wait 6 months to a year to see how much of your skin contracts and your breast tissue decompresses. You breasts may look funky for the first few weeks or even months, but it will get better over time and you may not need any additional procedures to look good. If you do a lift...</div>

</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">There is no reason your original plastic surgeon could not have simply lifted your breasts instead of placing breast implants. Your breasts are large and ptotic, and your back and figure will probably look much better with implant removal and a lift. The downside is that you will have a lollipop scar on your breasts, but you will be changing shape for scar. I do not think your breasts will be too big after explantation, but I always ask my patients to bring me photos of their ideal breasts...</div>

</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">The benefit of waiting to lift is that you may never need to undergo a secondary lift procedure, and you will spare yourself unnecessary scars. In addition, a straightforward removal of your saline implants with en bloc capsulectomy will be an easier recovery than removal with a breast lift. At 25 years old, your skin should still have a fair amount of elasticity, so the shape will likely return. The implants have stretched out your skin and compressed your breast tissue, but over time your...</div>

</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Exparel helps to decrease pain but does not eliminate it. If you have zero pain tolerance cohesive gel implants under the muscle may be intolerably painful for you even with Exparel. You can try to add Valium or other muscle relaxers in addition to the pain medication, but at the end of the day it is the physical and mechanical presence of the breast implant under your muscle, which is ordinarily flat against your chest wall, that will be the problem. </div>

</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">It is definitely possible to stack a DIEP flap on top of another flap like a TUG flap. You need a microsurgeon who is comfortable performing stacked flaps. Usually, stacking a flap will provide much more volume to your breasts, and you will also have a scar at the donor site. Depending on how much more volume you need, fat grafting may also be a good option for you. Finally, it is possible to place implants under flaps.</div>

While higher risk, microsurgical flaps can definitely be successfully performed in patients who have undergone radiation to their donor sites.

<div class="fullTableCell">If saline implants are deflated, the breast loses the volume that was there from the implant. If you had a mastectomy, it would look flat with crumpled up skin on top. If you had a significant amount of breast tissue and only a small implant, it might look like an involuted breast after breastfeeding.

<div class="fullTableCell">Looking at your pictures, the best type of reconstruction after a unilateral mastectomy would be using natural tissue. If your nipple is involved in your cancer and you are not a candidate for nipple-sparing mastectomy, then I would recommend a periareolar incision with a vertical incision (like a lollipop) for the mastectomy.

<div class="fullTableCell">I would wait a minimum of three months after your first surgery before proceeding with breast fat transfer to increase their size. You want your body to heal and recover completely from the first surgery. In addition, your new breasts will settle and change over time, which can take several months or even a year, and you want to know what you're dealing with before undergoing another procedure.

<div class="fullTableCell">Since it has only been 2 months since you stopped breastfeeding, you may want to wait a few more months to see if your breast skin contracts more before undergoing surgery. If not, fat transfer is one way to increase volume, but some of the fat that is transferred will be absorbed so it may require more than one session of fat grafting. It appears that most of your volume loss is at the upper portion of your breasts, and the majority of your breast volume is at the bottom of your breasts due...</div>
